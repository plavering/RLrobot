# RLrobot
  This is the starting github to creating a robot RL model with simulation.
  This contains a program for person detection for future use for robot pathing which is optimized to run on a raspberry pi 5. The robot design was used by dan makes thing's open source bipedal robot. The link to the github is here. https://github.com/makerforgetech/modular-biped. (shown here This github was the insperation for the project. 



Here is an exmaple image of the robot in the simulator after conversion to xml.

# Camera
The camera object detection files include the .ipynb file and which prunes and quantizes the weights. The other files are used to test the camera system on the Pi5. demo.py is a file that runs the camera program on the Pi5.
